# GEOG458-Lab-2-Web-data-collection-and-word-clouds


The topic of this research is based off of my personal connection to my family's hometown, Hoi An Vietnam!
Hoi An is a town, often called ancient town with it's rich history and French colonial architecture surrounding canals and water. Many tourists visiting have this place embedded in their itinerary as they are famous for their lanterns, food and tailoring. 

Word Cloud 1 comes from the simple search of "Hoi An" in Youtube where the most popular terms relate to travel and exploration. Word Cloud 2 is a Youtube search of "Hoi An Flooding". The theme of the most occuring terms for this topic is about loss, severity, and affects on people. Two seemingly similar searches actually present different positive and negative angles on the same beautiful town. The contrast in experiences that occur in the same place and people. Since Hoi An is geographically located next to the water and embedded in canals, annual floods are common. But in 2025, natural disasters such as flooding was very severe, causing damage phsyically and financially to citizens of Vietnam and surrounding countries. 

Comparing the word clouds composed of frequent words from the video descriptions from video results, the tones of the terms are opposite. One was about the negative affects of natural disasters while the other is about the enjoyments of traveling there.

In the future, the research can be improved by added a more criitical analysis on the same topic and removing by hand un-needed terms from the word cloud as that can cloud and dilute the impact of the visualization. It was surprising to see that the terms for the first eord cloud did not reference popular attractions of the town.
